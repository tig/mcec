# MCE Controller

![MCE Controller](mainwindow.png)

**MCE Controller** provides robust remote control a Windows HTPC (or any PC) over the network. It runs in the background listening on the network (or serial port) for commands. It then translates those commands into actions such as keystrokes, text input, and the starting of programs. Any remote control, home control system, or application that can send text strings via TCP/IP or a serial port can use **MCE Controller** to control a Windows PC.

Almost any action a user can perform on Windows can be invoked remotely from another device on the network. This includes key presses (e.g. Alt-Tab or Win-S), mouse movements, and Window management actions (e.g. maximize window or set a window to the foreground)

**MCE Controller** works great with any remote control system that supports TCP/IP or RS-232 connections. Examples include [**Control4**](https://www.control4.com/), [**iRule**](http://www.iruleathome.com/), [**Crestron**](http://www.crestron.com/), and [**Premise Home Control**](http://cocoontech.com/forums/forum/51-premise-home-control/)

* Version 1.3.1 (January 4, 2012) – Fixed bug parsing -1 in the lParam of SendMessageCommands. Commented MCEController.commands. Minor code cleanup.
* Version 1.3.2 (January 4, 2012) – Fixed bug in how .commands and .settings are stored (Win7 broke permissions).
* Version 1.3.3 (January 9, 2012) – Added capability to send individual key presses with shift/ctrl/alt/win modifiers (what keys: originally was supposed to do).

* Version 1.5.2 (October, 4, 2012) - Fixed .settings file bug where it would sometimes read from Program Files and write to AppData. Now always writes to AppData unless started outside of Program Files. Fixed Setting dialog to be more resilient to bad data. Fixed Send Awake so that it does not fault on bad data, but logs errors. General code clean up. Built with VS2012.
