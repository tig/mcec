# Recreating the hero GIF (`docs/hero.gif`)

`docs/hero.gif` is the hero image shown at the top of [`README.md`](../README.md) and the docs home page
([`docs/index.md`](index.md), served at `https://tig.github.io/mcec/hero.gif`). It is MCEC dogfooding
itself: one MCEC drives a **second MCEC** through a guided tour — launch → **File ▸ Settings** (visit
every tab) → **mouse-resize** the window ~25% smaller by dragging its sizing border → **drag the title
bar in small circles** → **Help ▸ About** → pause — while the **on-screen command overlay** (#119)
narrates every command in burnt orange, all recorded by the agent
[`record`](agent-server.md#record--capturing-change-over-time) tool (#80). No external screen-recorder.

The two oranges line up on purpose: the overlay's item background is the **About box's brand orange**,
so the About dialog and the narration match.

## One-shot regeneration

On an interactive Windows session you can leave alone for ~30 seconds (it drives the real mouse,
keyboard, and launches an app):

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Generate-HeroGif.ps1        # add -Config Release to use a Release build
```

The script builds if needed, produces `docs/hero.gif`, and restores config afterward. Review the result;
if it looks good, commit `docs/hero.gif`.

## What the script does (and why)

It is the executable form of these decisions — replicate them if reproducing by hand:

1. **GUI controller that renders the overlay, driven over HTTP.** Unlike a headless `--mcp` controller, a
   **GUI** MCEC has a message loop and so paints the overlay. The controller's co-located `mcec.settings`
   sets `McpServerEnabled=true` (the localhost HTTP floor), `AgentCommandsEnabled=true`,
   `CommandOverlayEnabled=true`, and `CommandOverlayPosition=Left`; the driver POSTs JSON-RPC tool calls
   to `http://127.0.0.1:5151/mcp`.
2. **Separate, isolated subject copy.** The controlled MCEC is a *copy* of the build in
   `%TEMP%\mcec-hero-subject` so it reads its own co-located `mcec.settings` (`Program.ConfigPath` == the
   exe's folder) — isolated from the controller and your installed MCEC. Its config sets `ActAsServer=false`
   (else it binds `IPAddress.Any:5150` and triggers the first-run Windows Firewall prompt that steals focus
   and derails the tour), `DisableUpdatePopup=true`, turns its **own overlay off**
   (`CommandOverlayEnabled=false` — only the controller narrates), and **pins** `WindowLocation`/`WindowSize`.
3. **Launch it the way an agent would — Win+R, not `Start-Process`.** Dogfooding the composition principle
   in [Toward script-free recreation](#toward-script-free-recreation): the controller opens the **Win+R**
   Run dialog and types the subject's path (`winr` → `chars:<path>` → `enter`) via `send_command`, rather
   than an OS launch API. (`chars:` interprets C-style escapes, so the path's backslashes are doubled.) The
   freshly-launched window is foreground, so `query { foreground:true }` yields its **handle**; the script
   then drives the subject by handle (its "MCEC" title is ambiguous with the controller) and the modal
   dialogs by their unambiguous titles (`Settings`, `About`).
4. **Overlay docked Left over a wide window → compact capture.** With the overlay on the left of the wide,
   pinned, left-docked subject window, the recorded region is **just the window** — compact, no wallpaper —
   yet still contains the narration. The Settings/About dialogs are `CenterParent`, so they sit to the
   right of the left-hugging overlay. (Right is the product default; Left is chosen here only for the hero.)
5. **Clean backdrop.** All windows are minimized (`Shell.Application.MinimizeAll()`); the overlay is an
   independent top-most window and survives, so the controller's window stays minimized (out of frame)
   while its overlay keeps narrating.
6. **Record.** `record action:start` over the window region at a low fps, then drive the tour (Settings
   tabs → resize-drag → title-bar circles → About), then `record action:stop file:docs/hero.gif`.

## Manual MCP equivalent (no script)

Connect to the GUI controller's HTTP floor (`POST :5151/mcp`) once the subject's window is up (drive it
by its `handle`):

| Step | Tool call |
|------|-----------|
| Launch | `send_command winr` → `send_command "chars:<path>"` (backslashes doubled) → `send_command enter` → `query { foreground:true }` for the new window's `handle` |
| Start | `record` `{ action:"start", x, y, width, height, fps:4, maxWidth:560 }` (region = the subject window's pinned rect) |
| Settings | click **File** → send `S` → `query` the **Settings** window → click each tab header's rect (`mouse:mt,…` + `mouse:lbc`) in turn → `Esc` |
| Resize | drag the bottom-right sizing border inward: `mouse:mt` to the corner → `mouse:lbd` → a few `mouse:mt` moves → `mouse:lbu` |
| Move | drag the title bar in circles: `mouse:mt` onto the title bar → `mouse:lbd` → `mouse:mt` around a small circle → `mouse:lbu` |
| About | re-`query` the (moved) window by `handle` → click the **Help** menu item's rect → send `A` → `capture` `{ window:"About" }` |
| Stop | pause on the About box → `record` `{ action:"stop", file:"docs/hero.gif" }` |

## Tuning size

The GIF encoder writes full (non-diffed) frames, so **file size ≈ frame count × frame area**. The deeper
tour is tuned to ≈4 MB at 560 px wide, 4 fps. To shrink it, lower `fps`, lower `maxWidth`, or trim the
per-step dwell `Start-Sleep`s; to make it richer, raise them.

## Toward script-free recreation

A key aspect of MCEC is that a capable **agent composes the full command set creatively** — so the right
question isn't "can an agent recreate the hero?" but "how *robustly*?" The honest answer: **an agent can
already recreate almost all of this today with nothing but `mcec.exe`**, by combining existing primitives.
The `.ps1` reaches outside MCEC mainly for **determinism and convenience**, not because MCEC can't express
the step. The tracking issues below are about turning common compositions into first-class, robust actions
— not about unlocking the impossible.

**The one genuine primitive gap — the keystone (#122).** `query` reports control bounds in **pixels**,
but `mouse:mt` wants **normalized** 0–65535 coordinates, and there is no clean way to read the screen
geometry to bridge them; the script uses `GetSystemMetrics` for that. Give MCEC a **`displays`/geometry
query** (or pixel-/element-relative mouse targeting) and every mouse step below becomes composable from
commands that already exist.

**One bug, not a missing capability (#128).** Invoking a menu item that opens a **modal** wedges later UIA
queries of that dialog, so the tour opens Settings with a keystroke (`key_s`) rather than `invoke`. Fixing
it makes menu navigation fully `invoke`-based. (Meanwhile the keystroke *is* a valid creative composition.)

Everything else is **already composable today** — the issues just make the pattern first-class/robust:

| Step | Already composable today via | Enhancement (issue) |
|---|---|---|
| Launch the subject **(the hero already does this)** | Win+R: `send_command winr` → `chars:<path>` → `enter`, then `query { foreground:true }` for its handle | direct gated launch that returns the handle — robustness (#126) |
| Drag: resize border / title-bar circles | `mouse:lbd` → a path of `mouse:mt` → `mouse:lbu` (all existing commands) | first-class `drag` (#123); or window `move`/`resize` with an `animate` mode that still *looks* dragged (#124) |
| Switch Settings tabs | `query` the tab's bounds → `mouse` click its center | `select` / SelectionItem action (#125) |
| Record the window | `query` its bounds → `record { x, y, width, height }` | `record { handle }`, optionally following the window (#127) |
| Wait for a window/dialog | poll `query` until it appears | first-class wait-for-**window** predicate (#112) |

Every mouse row above still depends on the keystone (#122) for pixel→normalized conversion; give MCEC the
geometry query and the compositions in the middle column work as written.

Deliberately **out of scope** for the agent: provisioning the isolated subject (copy + config) and
enabling the actuation gates (`AgentCommandsEnabled`, per-command `Enabled`, and the overlay settings). An
agent enabling its own input would defeat the security model, so an operator does that first; the agent's
recipe begins after.
